# Pytradfri

This is a Python class to communicate with the [Ikea Tradfri](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00337813/) (Trådfri) Gateway over your local-network using encrypted [CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)](http://coap.technology/). The gateway acts as an ZigBee-based IoT (Internet of Things) hub which can control Ikea "Trådfri" series lights and also Philips Hue lightbulbs.

This is an implementation based on analysis [I](https://github.com/ggravlingen/) found [here](https://bitsex.net/software/2017/coap-endpoints-on-ikea-tradfri/) by [vidarlo](https://bitsex.net/). Jaime Jiménez (who is an active member of the IPSO Alliance working group) have also posted a very good teardown [here](http://jaimejim.github.io/tradfri/) of the Ikea Trådfri implementation which follows IPSO Smart Object guidelines. In addition, Matthew Garrett (Google security dev) have posted a deeper security analysis of the gateway [here](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/47803.html).

A lot of work was also put in by Paulus Schoutsen ([@balloob](https://github.com/balloob)) who took the initial code concept into this library.


## Installation
In order to use the code, you first need to install [libcoap](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap) (which contain "coap-client") as per the following instructions:

```shell
$ apt-get install libtool

$ git clone --depth 1 --recursive -b dtls https://github.com/home-assistant/libcoap.git
$ cd libcoap
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --disable-documentation --disable-shared --without-debug CFLAGS="-D COAP_DEBUG_FD=stderr"
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Stand-alone
If you want to test this library stand-alone:

```shell
$ python3 -i -m pytradfri IP KEY
```
Where the following variables are substituted:
- **IP** is the IP-address to your gateway (or FQDN if you have your own DNS server).
- **KEY** is the PKG-key written on the back of your Ikea Tradfri Gateway.

### Examples of commands in the stand-alone prompt:

List all lights: 
```shell
lights
```
Set brightnes of item 1 to 50 in lights list: 
```shell
lights[1].set_light_brightness(50)
```


## Implement in your own Python platform
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# put all of this in test_pytradfri.py
# Run by executing the following command from shell, from the same folder you have stored test_pytradfri.py in.
# python3 -m test_pytradfri IP KEY

# Pre-requisites
# pip3 install pytradfri

import sys
import pytradfri

# Assign configuration variables. The configuration check takes care they are present.
api = pytradfri.coap_cli.api_factory(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
gateway = pytradfri.gateway.Gateway(api)
devices = gateway.get_devices()
lights = [dev for dev in devices if dev.has_light_control]

# Print all lights
print(lights)

# Lights can be accessed by its index, so lights[1] is the second light

# Example 1: checks state of the light 2 (true=on)
print(lights[1].light_control.lights[0].state)

# Example 2: get dimmer level of light 2
print(lights[1].light_control.lights[0].dimmer)

# Example 3: What is the name of light 2
print(lights[1].name)

# Example 4: Set the light level of light 2
lights[1].light_control.set_dimmer(20)

# Example 5: Change color of light 2
lights[1].light_control.set_hex_color('f5faf6') # f5faf6 = cold | f1e0b5 = normal | efd275 = warm
```

### Docker

There is a Docker script available to bootstrap a dev environment. Run `./script/dev_docker` and you will build and launch a container that is ready to go. After launching, follow the above instructions to test the library stand-alone.
